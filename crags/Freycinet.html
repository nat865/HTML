        <h1>Freycinet National Park</h1>
        <h3>Where to stay</h3>
        <p>
            We took a small Toyota Corolla Seca on the 4wd track in a determined effort to make it to the campsite. It was terrifying but possible (if even somewhat) and well worth the effort (although not highly recommended).
            <br>If you make it to the campsite there is free camping within 50m of the all the best climbing in the area. The ground is flat with soft sand and constant mosquitos and there are picnic tables to dine + set up a kitchen on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Toiletries/Facilities</h3>
        <p>
            There is one long drop toilet shared by the whole camp which is relatively well maintained - you can find a small path leading to it from the right of the campground (facing out to sea).
            <br>There is no water - so bring your own (which makes driving in much more attractive. The alternative is a 1hr hike)
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>
            Beautiful weather given it is right next to the ocean. The campground is nice and shaded and the sea cliffs are exposed and very sunny.
