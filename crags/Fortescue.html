        <h3>Toiletries/Facilities</h3>
        <p>
            Very upper class toilets, hot showers, undercover picnic areas with bbq's and tap water (although please be conservative and bring your own water)

        <h3>Weather</h3>
        <p>
            It was incredibly windy when we went. And given you are climbing sea stacks the wind factor is ramped up by 10x
